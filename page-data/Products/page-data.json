It has a narrow mouth to concentrate the aromas at the top of the glass and a handle to avoid warming the beer up.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/21eebf06842195daf2014a24474d39f79834e48a-103x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"straight-stein"}}},{"node":{"_id":"2b234b0b-b293-49f9-b042-6c6265d0bdf1","price":600,"title":"Amber Chalice","description":"Another great glass for a great ale – whether it’s a dark, amber, brown or even a stout, this glass truly showcases the terrific attributes of the beer.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/ff2e55770b1c57fe273b07441ee9da02887ec90f-79x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"amber-chalice"}}},{"node":{"_id":"30034c5f-c72b-4fb4-a9c6-b674b8dfbc60","price":500,"title":"Flared Pilsener","description":"Pilseners are lagers with slightly more bitterness and aromas and therefore need a glass that embodies the style. This tall glass with the flared opening help concentrate the aromas of the beer on the top of the glass.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/a4212a451fdc888400f4a6c9136259cc62647786-61x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"flared-pilsener"}}},{"node":{"_id":"3a6b0093-bcac-43b6-959d-e9954e9440d8","price":400,"title":"Hourglass","description":"An hourglass is a multi-dimensional glass. Tall and narrow, it also has a mouth that presents a variety of flavours and aromatics. Fill it with an amber lager or amber ale such as a honey brown and truly savour the great beer.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/ba7a4ddc1865a5b17dd955f63100ad2db6cfb012-64x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"hourglass"}}},{"node":{"_id":"45bd2a91-cde5-4eb0-8fb7-229cd80849c5","price":900,"title":"Tulip","description":"Strong beers (Trappist styles or bocks) are well presented in the tulip glass. The open mouth brings the nose of the beer to life while the round body allows you to warm it up, intensifying those wonderful flavours. A tulip-shaped glass is also a good fit for fruit beers.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/42d5ae213232cb40b690878d131e3b4c74349bd0-58x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"tulip"}}},{"node":{"_id":"98aa7a5b-f1b1-4ae1-9022-de829addaf31","price":550,"title":"Dimpled Mug","description":"Full bodied ales are a good choice for this glass. The handle is large enough to get your hand around the glass if you want to warm it up. Like it a little colder? Use the handle! A nice wide mouth will bring all those great flavours to your tastebuds very easily.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/7546f9681921cfe89b97fa4ba30a46e904209fcd-124x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"dimpled-mug"}}},{"node":{"_id":"9ce3b987-d4c3-4efb-9ddb-88360f7151a9","price":300,"title":"Snifter","description":"Who says snifters are only for brandy? They’re also great for specialty beers. The short stem invites the drinker to envelop the glass, bringing up the temperature in the beer.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/0829dde3cba6e2bee1cf9e28038c727ab82a525e-86x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"snifter"}}},{"node":{"_id":"c8ad9e38-57b0-4f20-9e7a-8e9f96d199ea","price":450,"title":"Footed Pilsener","description":"This is a great glass for a typical Canadian ale. These ales have the fruity, floral aromas of an ale but are refreshing and smooth like a lager. The aromas are not overly abundant and this glass narrows the focus for the drinker.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/5879b09bd7f5f720b670913c6ac61daa5f1efd8a-59x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"footed-pilsener"}}},{"node":{"_id":"c9ace99f-6334-4fca-b568-7a5988f45393","price":350,"title":"Pub Glass","description":"A pub glass is great for a variety of ales. Ales, like red wines, need a glass with a wide open mouth.

This stemmed glass offers benefits to the drinker – tall and narrow to focus the great aromas at the top and a stem to keep your hand away from the beer.","image":{"asset":{"url":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/tkkfo8fa/production/ce518c90c63a2e2f4d960cbff1dd1cd413fdf5d9-65x130.jpg"}},"slug":{"current":"stemmed-lager"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
